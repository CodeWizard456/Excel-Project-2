# Excel-Project-2
I have completed Excel projects that involve various functions such as AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and COUNT for data analysis. Additionally, I utilized CONCAT function for combining text, and Date functions for calculating sales by date. These functions were used to streamline data management and provide useful insights.
